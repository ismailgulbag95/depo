# Make Interfaces Feel Better

Use this skill for the small design-engineering details that compound into a
more polished interface.

Source: salvaged from stale community PR #1659 by `linus707`.

## When to Use

- The user says the UI feels off, flat, generic, cramped, jumpy, or unfinished.
- You are building controls, cards, lists, dashboards, navigation, forms, or
  toolbars.
- A component needs hover, active, focus, enter, exit, loading, or empty states.
- A frontend review needs specific before/after recommendations.

## Core Principles

### Concentric Radius

For nearby nested rounded surfaces:

```text
outer radius = inner radius + padding
```

If padding is large, treat layers as separate surfaces instead of forcing the
math. The point is optical coherence, not formula worship.

### Optical Alignment

Geometric centering is not always visual centering. Icon buttons, play
triangles, arrows, stars, and asymmetric icons often need a small offset. Fix the
SVG when possible; otherwise adjust with a pixel-level margin or padding change.

### Shadows And Borders

Use borders for separation and focus rings. Use layered shadows when a card,
button, dropdown, or popover needs depth. Shadows should be transparent and
subtle enough to work across backgrounds.

### Text Wrapping

- Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings and short titles.
- Use `text-wrap: pretty` on short-to-medium body text, captions, descriptions,
  and list items.
- Avoid both on long prose, code, and preformatted content.
- Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for counters, timers, prices, tables,
  and other updating numbers.

### Hit Areas

Interactive controls should have at least a 40x40px hit area, ideally 44x44px
where the layout allows it.
